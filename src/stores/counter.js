//a store acts like a class with behavior but is a reactive object that can be shared between components
//the store is defined with a name and an object with state, getters, and actions
//state is a function that returns an object with the initial state of the store
//getters is an object with functions that return derived state
//actions is an object with functions that can modify the state
//the store is exported to be used in components




//To put it short gettes are just computed values
//actions are just methods that can modify the state
//state is just the data that the store holds
